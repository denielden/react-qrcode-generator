# QR Code Generator component - Frontend Mentor

This challenge was to build the QR Code component, but it has become something more complex than a simple component!  
Inspired by another project, I also wanted to add features to this challenge:
- On load, it shows the default basic QR Code
- Added a form that allows the user to enter a website URL to generate a QR Code for it
- Dynamically update the QR Code as you type the URL
- Dynamically update the color and background of the QR Code based on the customization input entered by the user
- When the form is sent, the `.png` of the generated QR Code is downloaded 
  
This is a evolved solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [QRCode.react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.react) - For QR Code

### What I learned

With this challenge I had the opportunity to learn and deepen:
- the use and manipulation of `QRCode.react`
- the correct use of `Refs` in react
- how the html `canvas` element works behind the scenes

I am eager to further evolve this project and learn much more!

### Continued development

Add new features:
- Insert custom image inside the QR Code
- Choose the format of the image to download 
- Connect with serverless database
- SignIn/Login
- Save the QR Code generated
