## Overview

### About App

This app generates QR Code based on the url entered.

Features: 
- On load, it shows the default basic QR Code
- Added a form that allows the user to enter a website URL to generate a QR Code for it
- Dynamically update the QR Code as you type the URL
- Dynamically update the color and background of the QR Code based on the customization input entered by the user
- When the form is sent, the `.png` of the generated QR Code is downloaded

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [QRCode.react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.react) - For QR Code
- [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) - For Color Pickers

### What I learned

With this challenge I had the opportunity to learn and deepen:
- the use and manipulation of `QRCode.react`
- the correct use of `Refs` in react
- how the html `canvas` element works behind the scenes

I am eager to further evolve this project and learn much more!

### Continued development

Add new features:
- Insert custom image inside the QR Code
- Choose the format of the image to download 
- Connect with serverless database
- SignIn/Login
- Save the QR Code generated
